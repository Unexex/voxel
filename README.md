## Welcome to Voxel 1.&#x20;

Voxel is a superfast, simple language made for all purposes.

### Downloading Voxel.

Head over to [https://github.com/Unexex/voxel/tree/main/src](https://github.com/Unexex/voxel/tree/main/src). Download vm, libraries and hosts.&#x20;

With them downloaded parent them to a single folder.

Call the folder "voxel"

### Compiling

To compile, find vm that you just downloaded. and compile vm as you would with Lua.

### Setting up

In hosts find the host with the same file extension as your script&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
host.cpp is made for the command line.
