## Welcome to Voxel 1.

Voxel is a superfast, simple language made for all purposes.

This tutorial will guide you through getting Voxel running.

### Downloading Voxel.

Head over to [https://github.com/Unexex/voxel/tree/main/src](https://github.com/Unexex/voxel/tree/main/src). Download vm, libraries and hosts.

With them downloaded parent them to a single folder.

Call the folder "voxel"

### Setting up

Now you need to build vm. Find the .bat file that corresponds to your device and run it. Then find the MakeFile in vm and run that. The new folder you found should be placed with your project file or host

Find a file in hosts that is compatible with your script as a library. Import that as a library to use that. Read the API documentation to learn how to use that.
