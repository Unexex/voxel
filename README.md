## Welcome to Voxel 1.&#x20;

Voxel runs as a library for multiple languages. Each language uses the same API.



### Downloading Voxel.

Head over to [https://github.com/Unexex/voxel/tree/main/src](https://github.com/Unexex/voxel/tree/main/src), Find the file named \*-host (Replace \* with your language). Make sure you also use [vm](https://github.com/Unexex/voxel/tree/main/src/vm) with the host.



### Setting up

Parent all the files you just downloaded in the same parent file as you did with your project.

Import the host with a script and use that as an API.



Read the API documentation to learn how to use the API
